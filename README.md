This Chrome extension captures saved passwords that are saved and autofilled, or any password input field in real time. It works on password managers such as LastPass, Keeper, or 1Password. It then sends them to a web server that outputs the contents onto a txt file, the passwords are also displayed in console within Chrome. 
Localhost web server does not need firewall rules or a https certificate. In order to install the Chrome extension, it either needs to be done with Group Policies and Registry, or manually in Developer Mode. The server.go can also be used as FTP or reverse shell if wished to with added capabilities. I plan to implement those next. 

Why Golang?  I initially used a python simple server, but decided to make it into a Go server for ease of distribution. If Python interpreter is installed in a machine, no firewall prompts are set off. However, even if a firewall prompt by Windows is denied, the server.go, can still receive passwords within the local machine.
